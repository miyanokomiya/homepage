I believe Silent is obviously weaker than other characters, can be the weakest to be honest, so it's not my fault that she was slain by the Heart's 67 no mercy slap.

Is it true??? I don't know. We often face innevitable death in this game. I can't distinguish if each death is innevitable.
In order to prove my excuses, I have to get to know about her mitigation ability more deeply anyway. It's the main theme of this post.
