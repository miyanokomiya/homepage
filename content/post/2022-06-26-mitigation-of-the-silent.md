I believe Silent is obviously weaker than other characters, can be the weakest to be honest, so it's not my fault that she was slain by the heart's 67 no mercy slap.

Is it true??? I don't know. We often face inevitable death in this game. I can't distinguish if each death is inevitable.
In order to prove my excuses, I have to get to know about her mitigation ability more deeply anyway. It's the main theme of this post.

## Final Destination
Of course, our final destination is beating the corrupt heart. Silent has a variety of way to deal decent damage indeed. If you have "Deadly Poison+", "Catalyst+" and "Burst+" on your hand, you can instantly accumulate (7+7)x3x3=126. Besides, the poison remains over turns, then all we have to do is surviving until our foe melted.

The problem is how the hell we can survive such an insane heart's attacks. Let's get into this theme.

Simply put, our goal is surviving first routine of the heart. The heart gives us 67 single attack and 3x15 multiple attacks arbitrarily followed by first debuffing turn. To make matters worse, the heart imposes "frail" and a bunch of status cards upon us.

## Mitigation
As a non-native English speaker, I didn't know this word "mitigation" so far and got to know thanks to this video. No matter how many I get slapped by the heart, I'm still able to get something worth. What a great game.

### Best Solutions
One of the strongest solutions to survive the heart's first routine is "intangible". Silent has far more way to access intangibility.

Wraith Form
Apparition
Ghost In A Jar
Incense Burner

### Second Best Solutions

Piercing Wail
Dark Shackles

Fairy in a Bottle
Lizard Tail
Fossilized Helix

### Helping Solutions
Tungsten Rod
