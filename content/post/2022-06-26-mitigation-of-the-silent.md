I believe Silent is obviously weaker than other characters, can be the weakest to be honest, so it's not my fault that she was slain by the heart's 67 no mercy slap.

Is it true??? I don't know. We often face inevitable death in this game. I can't distinguish if each death is inevitable.
In order to prove my excuses, I have to get to know about her mitigation ability more deeply anyway. It's the main theme of this post.

## Final Destination
Of course, our final destination is beating the corrupt heart. Silent has a variety of way to deal decent damage indeed. If you have "Deadly Poison+", "Catalyst+" and "Burst+" on your hand, you can instantly accumulate (7+7)x3x3=126. Besides, the poison remains over turns, then all we have to do is surviving until our foe melted.

The problem is how the hell we can survive such an insane heart's attacks. Let's get into this theme.

Simply put, our goal is surviving first routine of the heart. The heart gives us 67 single attack and 3x15 multiple attacks arbitrarily followed by first debuff turn. To make matters worse, the heart imposes "frail" and a bunch of status cards upon us.

Things aren't looking good for us apparently. What should we do againt this insane situation? The keyword is "the frontloading multiple-turn mitigation".

## Mitigation
As a non-native English speaker, I didn't know this word "mitigation" so far and got to know thanks to this video. No matter how many I get slapped by the heart, I'm still able to get something worth. What a great game.

### Powerful Solutions
One of the strongest solutions to survive the heart's first routine is "Intangible". Silent has far more way to access intangibility.

#### Wraith Form
This is definitely one of the strongest cards in the spire. When I first saw this card, I thought it was pretty stinky. As I ascended the spire, it became my soul mate. It's mine. No one can take it away from my boss rewards.

Losing 1 dexterity each turn is certainly awful. However, don't forget that we never be able to slay the heart unless mitigating both of two no mercy attacks enough lower than our HP.

"Wraith Form" is definitely the frontloading multiple-turn mitigation. We still have to deal 1x15 damage though, it won't be a big issue.

"Intangible" also reduces "Beat of Death" 2 to 1. It makes our life easier as well. Once we play "Wraith Form", we can get 3 forgiving turns. Even if it isn't upgraded, we don't have to worry about 4th turn so seriously.

Set some late combat problems aside, "Wraith Form" gives us "the frontloading multiple-turn mitigation" enough to survive the heart's first routine. Just one card does it, so good, so poggy. Praise "Wraith Form".

As long as we have "Wraith Form" somehow until facing the heart, mitigation problem against the heart is almost solved. On the other hand, what can we do if we don't have any "Wraith Form"? The rest of this article is mainly about the situation.

Remember, praise "Wraith Form".

#### Apparition
This is also one of the strongest cards in the spire. Needless to say, we can pass through the first routine as long as we can play it at the specific turn.

This card also imposes us to have lower max HP. It usually means we couldn't endure the first routine without getting intangible.

### Good Solutions

Piercing Wail
Dark Shackles

#### Ghost In A Jar
Unless "Sacred Bark", we can pass through only one of two attacks by this potion. However, this mitigation has a great consistency. We can use it whenever we want!

Although this potion is way too strong, we should not entirely rely on only it. If this is the only way of your frontloading mitigation, you might be forced to use it to survive in the previous elite fight. If so, what you can do againt the heart is just a greeting.
